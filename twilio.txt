Scenario
Suppose you have an online service where users need to verify their phone numbers during registration. You decide to use Twilio's Verify API for this purpose.
Step-by-Step Cost Analysis

    Verification Request
        When a user registers, you send an SMS verification code to their phone number.
        Twilio charges $0.05 per verification request.

    Verification Check
        After the user receives the SMS, they enter the verification code on your website.
        You then use Twilio's API to check if the entered code is correct.
        Twilio charges $0.01 per verification check.



Example Calculation
Day 1: You have 1,000 users registering and verifying their phone numbers.

    Verification Requests Cost
        1,000 verification requests at $0.05 each.
        Total cost: 1,000×0.05=$50.001,000×0.05=$50.00

    Verification Checks Cost
        1,000 verification checks at $0.01 each.
        Total cost: 1,000×0.01=$10.001,000×0.01=$10.00

Total Daily Cost for 1,000 Users

    Verification requests: $50.00
    Verification checks: $10.00
    Total: $60.00

Monthly Cost Estimation

If you expect to have 1,000 users registering and verifying their phone numbers every day:

    Daily Cost: $60.00
    Monthly Cost: 60×30=$1,80060×30=$1,800

Additional Considerations

    SMS Messaging Costs:
        If you also send other types of SMS messages to your users (e.g., notifications, reminders), this will incur additional costs.
        For the US, sending or receiving a standard SMS message is $0.0079 each​ (Twilio)​.

    Volume Discounts:
        Twilio offers volume discounts as your usage grows. It's worth discussing with their sales team if you anticipate high usage to potentially reduce costs.
